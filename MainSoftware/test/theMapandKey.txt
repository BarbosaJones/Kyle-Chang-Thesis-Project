For now, orientation will be Palm Down, until we learn how to access accelerometer and mag.

This document only will accomplish a few individual finger flex for testing purposes.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Flex can only happen during rest state.

No two fingers may be controlled at once for testing purposes, keeping the state machine very linear.
(from rest state, to one finger flexed state, back to rest state)

Let all readings for each pod be read as abs().

Let us assign the threshold for "neighborhood or about 0" to be 5.

********************************************************************************************************************************
Average Handler sub-state machine:
	(seperate state machine from finger states, these states determine how an average should be handled for each pod)
if last 5 readings are neighborhood of 0 && mark = 0, 
	reset average to 0, 

if average is in neighborhood of 0 && outlier data is read && mark = 0, 
	reset average count to start at that reading, add defined mark

(marks = const int value set at beginning of program, can be changed before compiling when needed)

if marked,
	-1 mark
	

(which means last  readings for each pods needs to be saved, new data popped into the front of the array each time)

********************************************************************************************************************************
Rest State: 
	- If all averages are about 0 && in rest state, stay in rest state
	- If not in rest state but all averages are about 0, change to Rest State
	- Transitioning out of state, look at transition state
	- When entering rest state, return all finger values to 0


********************************************************************************************************************************
Transition State:
	(This state senses change and handles the data in a way it can be used to determine the next state)
		- STEP1 : Any pods with averages > 10 triggers this state 
		- CASE1 : If the next 10 readings prove to maintain this increased averages,
			*Scan all 8 pods
				--if averages of POD1 >= 10, POD7 >= 10, POD4 >= 10, POD6 >= 10 POD8 >= 10
					change to index finger state 
		
			  else return to rest state		

********************************************************************************************************************************
Index Finger State:
	Increase Index finger by 180 when entering this state
	Stay in this state until rest state is triggered.
