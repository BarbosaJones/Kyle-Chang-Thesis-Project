Program that processes raw signals and maps to 5 finger outputs. 
Uses machine learning algorithms to recognize placements of myo armband, as well as
state machines to decide directions of finger flex depending on the current state 
of the "digital" finger. Digital finger is represented as a number in the software which
determines a virtual position.
