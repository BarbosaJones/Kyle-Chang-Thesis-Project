*past weeks, created state machines and testing out fingers control with basic characterization data.
*decided that we need to use digital transformation of signals from time domain to frequency domain using fourier
transformation to see more defined characteristics of the signals. Will spend the next few days reviewing fourier 
transformation and how to translate it into C++ code, as I am only familiar with applying fourier transformation 
in matlab
