*Recorded data for individual finger characteristics
	-Added the data text files
	-Plotted the data text files
*Still need to do many other gestures and combinations, but the main chunks which consist of the individual finger characteristics 
	been completed. Soon, I must analyze the characteristics to create a map to finger control in my program.
*Next step will be to add on to the current program which reads the raw data. I must add 5 more columns of integers which represent
	a virtual hand, represented by integers where positive is flexed, negative is closed, and 0 is relaxed.
	-This virtual hand will be used in conjunction with the mapped library of gesture characteristics to create a complex
		statemachine. The virtual hand's 5 integers will be altered determined by the raw signals coming in from the 
		myo armband.
